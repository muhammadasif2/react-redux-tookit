# React Redux Toolkit

This is a simple CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application built using React, Redux Toolkit, and React Router. The app demonstrates essential state management with Redux Toolkit and provides seamless navigation between different views using React Router. The application allows users to add, edit, delete, and view items with the core CRUD operations. It is designed to be efficient, scalable, and easy to extend for larger projects.

## Key technologies used:

- React for building the user interface.
- Redux Toolkit for managing global state in a simpler and more efficient way.
- React Router for navigating between different pages/views in the application.
